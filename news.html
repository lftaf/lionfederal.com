										<h3>“DigiCloud Services Awarded GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS)”</h3>
										<p>DigiCloud Services—a mentor-protégé joint venture between Ventera Corporation
											and Lion Federal has been accepted onto the GSA Multiple Award Schedule
											(MAS) contract vehicle. Under the MAS Program, GSA issues long-term
											governmentwide contracts that provide federal, state, and local government
											buyers access to commercial products, services and solutions at pre
											negotiated pricing. The GSA Schedule is structured to support the 12 large
											categories established by OMB under the category management approach of
											smarter buying. The Schedule is further divided into subcategories and
											Special Item Numbers (SINs) that are aligned to NAICS codes to simplify the
											process for buyers and sellers to understand the scope of GSA’s offerings
											and find what the products and services they are looking to buy or offer.
											The MAS Program supports GSA's Federal Marketplace (FMP) strategy of
											modernizing and simplifying the buying and selling experience for all
											stakeholders.
